# The Troll's Toll

This is an alpha version of a "choose your own adventure" game. Done with SQL, Express, Handlebars, and Node. My team and I had a lot of
fun making this one. It's a silly story about a person trying to cross a bridge.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/m-scarr/TrollsToll
```
Run a mySQL server at port 8080, the user name and password are both "root".<br />
Open the root directory in the bash.
```
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd..
yarn start
```

### Prerequisites

There are a few things you'll need to get it running, if you tried the above, and it didn't work it could be because you dont have some of these things installed:

```
npm install yarn -g
npm install nodemon -g
npm install concurrently -g
```

### Features
+ Encrypted user system (BCrypt and Passport)
+ Full Mobile usability
+ Fun interactive branching story!
