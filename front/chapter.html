            The sound of rushing water can be heard up ahead of you, and you see a clearing. You run forward, eager to get a drink. Your
            grandpa told you before you left that dehydration was a dangerous thing, after all.
            <br>
            <br>In the clearing you are disappointed to find a troll guarding a bridge. He's covered in moss and has eyes like
            igneous rocks. That's all you really need to know, right? He's a troll.
            <br>
            <br>In a gravely voice he says, "Pay up, human, or you can't cross."
            <br>
            <br>What do you do?
